# **Hi, I'm Moussa El Najmi 👋**

**Senior Cloud Architect | AWS | Hybrid Cloud | IaC | Security Architecture**

I design secure, scalable, multi-account cloud architectures across AWS and hybrid enterprise environments. My work focuses on:

* AWS landing zones
* Hybrid cloud (Direct Connect, TGW, VPN)
* Application modernization (serverless, containers, microservices)
* Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Terragrunt)
* Cloud security & Zero Trust
* Observability & distributed system design

This portfolio showcases **end-to-end architecture patterns** I’ve designed and delivered for enterprises, including high availability, event-driven pipelines, secure EKS deployments, landing zones, hybrid cloud topologies, and data platforms.
